### WELCOME

Welcome to the information page for POI/INQ quest services hosted by Causality on Noctera! If you have never participated in our quest service before, please read this entire page so you are ready and prepared to complete the quest service with us successfully. Both **Pits&nbsp;of&nbsp;Inferno** (_referred to as "POI"_) and **Inquisition** (_referred to as "INQ"_) are intricate quests, where stepping on the wrong square means you die, so listen to the volunteers running the event!

### BASIC RULES

**RULE #1** - _**Questions Regarding Service:** Direct your POI/INQ questions to **@Raves&nbsp;Gard#6886** (on Discord) and him only. Guild Leadership is focused on managing the guild as a whole, and doesn't need to be taken away from this important task to answer event service questions._

**RULE #2** - _**Questing Errors / No Reward Room Access:** We take zero responsibility for people who refuse to use the Discord Voice Channel to listen to the careful and precise instructions provided by our volunteers. If you go ahead of the pack and get sniped, or double step, or miss a throne/portal/seal, you will not be refunded your fee. It is your responsibility to have Discord open and be connected to the voice channel. Our volunteers are there to guide you through these very intricate quests._

**RULE #3** - _**Staging Areas:** If you do not meet at the designated staging area to be accepted into the service party, you will be PK'ed if we see you at the event area. **Only at the Staging Area will participants be added to the service party.**_

**RULE #4** - _**Answer Your Own Questions:** If you ask a question that has already been answered by this POI/INQ reference page, that question will be ignored. There are a lot of people asking lots of different questions, that we can only focus on the ones that are not already answered by the information we've provided on this page. **If your question is being ignored, this rule is why.**_

**RULE #5** - _**Keep Channels Clear:** Any posts on the text channel (#poiinq on [Causality Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zbUvG4k)) that are not about POI/INQ will be deleted - this channel is only for POI/INQ related conversation. Please limit your conversation on the voice channel (#POI/INQ on [Causality Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zbUvG4k)) to POI/INQ related conversation where appropriate, so volunteers can coordinate effectively and participants can be heard when they need assistance._

**RULE #6** - _**Ignore Us On Discord At Your Own Risk:** If you are participating in this quest service and are not connected to the voice channel (#POI/INQ on [Causality Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zbUvG4k)) during the quest service and you run into problems, that's your own problem. Support will only be provided in voice channel. Support will not be provided via chat messages within Tibia._

### GENERAL PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

**REQ #1** - Free for guild members of Causality, and their alt characters.

**REQ #2** - 50k fee per quest (that's 50k for POI _and another_ 50k for INQ) for "Guests" (non-guild-members)

**REQ #3** - Guests must reserve their spot a minimum of 3 hours in advance of the POI/INQ Service by mailing in your participation fee to **Raves&nbsp;Gard** by parcel _along with a letter stating the participating character name, level, vocation and which events you are attending (POI, INQ, or BOTH)_

**REQ #4** - **PARTICIPATION FEES WILL NO LONGER BE ACCEPTED AT THE STAGING AREA** - see REQ # 3 regarding guest reservations.

**REQ #5** - This service is expected to last 2.5 hours (1 hour for each quest with 30 minutes refill/regroup time in between) but can last longer. We will do our best to start on time but provide no guarantees.

**REQ #6** - If you are participating in INQ only, include your Discord username in your parcel letter so we can provide you with timing updates as POI progresses.
