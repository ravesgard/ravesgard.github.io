### WELCOME

Welcome to the information page for POI/INQ quest services hosted by Causality on Noctera! If you have never participated in our quest service before, please read this entire page so you are ready and prepared to complete the quest service with us successfully. Both **Pits of Inferno** (_referred to as "POI"_) and **Inquisition** (_referred to as "INQ"_) are intricate quests, where stepping on the wrong square means you die, so listen to the volunteers running the event!

### BASIC RULES

**RULE # 1** - _**Questions Regarding Service:** Direct your POI/INQ questions to @Raves Gard#6886 and him only. Guild Leadership is focused on managing the guild as a whole, and doesn't need to be taken away from this important task to answer event service questions.

**RULE # 2** - _**Questing Errors / No Reward Room Access:** We take zero responsibility for people who refuse to use the Discord Voice Channel to listen to the careful and precise instructions provided by our volunteers. If you go ahead of the pack and get sniped, or double step, or miss a throne/portal/seal, you will not be refunded your fee. It is your responsibility to have Discord open and be connected to the voice channel. Support will not be provided via in-game text-based chat channels. Our volunteers are there to guide you through these very intricate quests._

**RULE # 3** - _**Staging Areas:** If you do not meet at the designated staging area to be accepted into the service party, you will be PK'ed if we see you at the event area. **Only at the Staging Area will participants be added to the service party.**_

**RULE # 4** - _**Answer Your Own Questions:** If you ask a question that has already been answered by a pinned post in this channel, that question will be ignored. There are a lot of people asking lots of different questions, that we can only focus on the ones that are not already answered by the information we've provided in this channel. **If your question is being ignored, this rule is why.**_

**RULE # 5** - _**Keep Channels Clear:** Any posts on the #poiinq text channel (on Causality Discord) that are not about POI/INQ will be deleted - this channel is only for POI/INQ related conversation. Please limit your conversation on the #POI/INQ voice channel (on Causality Discord) to POI/INQ related conversation where appropriate, so volunteers can coordinate effectively and participants can be heard when they need assistance.

### GENERAL PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

#1 - Free for guild members of Causality, and their alt characters.
